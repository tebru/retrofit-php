/**
 * Composer Wrapper
 *
 * You may use this file as you would the standard composer command line tool.
 * This script is made to wrap the composer script. It will download composer
 * and place the executable phar file in the `bin/` folder of the project if
 * it is not already available. When the executable phar is available this
 * script will forward all commands to the composer executable.
 * To change/update composer version, see the url below.
